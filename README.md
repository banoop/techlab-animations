# Techlab Animations
JAVA animations made for techlab during summer internship.

These animations range from sorting to Conway's Game of Life, and they are used at [TechLab Education](https://techlab.education) in their online video series. All of the code is well documented and can be easily taught to students in order to expand their knowledge of JAVA.

## Sorting Animation

Uses different types of sorts to create a gradient of colors before displaying the techlab logo.
